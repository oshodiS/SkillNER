# Project Description:
**Text Data Processing and Skill Extraction Toolkit:** This project provides a comprehensive toolkit for cleaning, preprocessing, and extracting skills from text data. It includes functions for text cleaning, creating matchers for skill extraction, annotating text with skills, and visualizing annotated skills in HTML format. The toolkit also offers methods for calculating similarity scores between text spans and skills, fetching databases from remote repositories, and extracting word frequencies from text. Developers can leverage these tools to streamline text processing, skill extraction, and data analysis tasks efficiently.
